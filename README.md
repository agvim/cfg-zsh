# cfg-zsh: The zsh configuration

This is a homeshick configuration repository. See
https://github.com/agvim/homeshick

This configuration depends and complements my bash configuration
https://github.com/agvim/cfg-bash

This configuration uses prezto zsh as a base with the following modifications:

- vim style keymaps
- two lines solarized debian style prompt
- prompt with the status of the last command and vi-mode in the last prompt
- prompt with a background color line to separate command executions
- deactivated some prezto modules I do not use
- powerline symbols in the prompt
